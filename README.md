## Introduction

The dynamic development of wind power in recent years has generated a demand for reliable forecasting tools in wind farms. Accurate predictions of power generation allow operators to control turbine operations in real time and plan maintenance activities effectively. This document reviews the currently applied methods of wind power generation forecasting, highlighting physical and statistical approaches, as well as hybrid methods that combine both.

## Forecasting Methods

### Persistence Method

The simplest forecasting method, based on the assumption that future wind power output will be the same as the current output. This method is primarily useful for ultra-short-term forecasts.

### Physical Methods

These methods utilize atmospheric data and numerical weather predictions (NWP). They rely on physical relationships between weather phenomena and wind farm characteristics to forecast wind behavior.

### Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP)

NWP models simulate atmospheric conditions using mathematical equations. These models provide forecasts based on grid nodes that describe meteorological fields, focusing on factors such as wind speed and pressure.

### Statistical Methods

Statistical methods analyze historical data to establish relationships between input variables (e.g., wind speed) and output variables (e.g., power generation). Common models include:
- Autoregressive (AR)
- Moving Average (MA)
- Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA)
- Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)

### Hybrid Methods

Hybrid approaches combine physical and statistical models to leverage the strengths of both. This integration improves forecasting accuracy, particularly during extreme weather events.
